            <p>“Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.”

                “People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.”
                
                “So many people say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day.”
                
                “Thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself.”
                
                “Intelligence solves problems and produces money.”
                
                “You must know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets.”
                
                An asset puts money in your pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket.
                
                “Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle.”
                
                “Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws, putting a spotlight on what we don’t know.”
                
                “Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.”
